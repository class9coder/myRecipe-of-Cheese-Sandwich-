Preparation...

First, mix all the fillings taken in a bowl/cup, then, spread this mixture over a bread taken in a plate. Cover the bread, then, spread the butter properly to grease it and take a sandwitch maker, then, grill your sandwich for a specified time. Finally, your cheese sandwitch is ready to be served with green chutney and ketchup.
